            <p class="we">Well, we are a startup and we are still very far from becoming a firemly established instutution in our industry. Based in Bhairahawa, Rupandehi, we primarily work on music videos in Nepali language but we are flexible enough to venture out from only producing music videos if the moment calls for it.</p>

                <p>One can guess, as an institution, our objective is obviously to make profits but what drives us is the immaculate desire to produce quality. It is and always has been our primary objective to achieve excellence as it is always the first ingredient if you want to cook success.</p>

                        <p class="top"> During the lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, an idea was pitched among Mr. Pranjal Pokhrel and his peers to establish a startup, one which had the potential to become a substantial production studio. This is where PAR Entertainment first spawned in our thoughts.  </p>

                        <p class="top">On 23 June, 2021, PAR Entertainment was officially registered as a private firm. This opened so many doors inculiding the ability to have our own domain, legitimate social media handles and so on. This date is marked as our official establishment.</p>

                        <p class="top">It took us a few months but we finally started on our first ever project: Samaya, a music video based on a love triangle.
                            This signified the first time that we actually started doing what we longed for ever since the inception of PAR Entertainment. </p>
